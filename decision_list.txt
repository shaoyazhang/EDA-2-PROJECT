You are given 4 arrows of each element. You have an arrow that burst fire, another that bursts water,
a normal wood arrow (thiner than stone) and a stone arrow (which is stronger than wood).
Idea is they use them along other skills until they defeat the devil of each place without reaching 0 life points.
Of course in any given moment they can jump, and other things to avoid attacks.


· 1st decision: Protection.

******************************************** " Choose your protection wisely" ***************************************************
Here, they can choose between: 

Opt 1: Whole body armor 

-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

Choosen in wood, life points get reduced to significantly less when attacked.
In fire, theyreduce a little bit the attack but doesn't help with the flames in the floor. !Not good option for fire.
If chosen in the Earth field scenario, it provides high protection against stone attacks and reduces the damage taken. However, 
if the player triggers a rock trap in the hidden mines he will recieve +25% of damage.
In the Water field scenario, the whole body armor offers protection against some physical attacks from enemies encountered along the way.
However, it doesn't aid in swimming or traversing the river.

Opt 2: Flying boots

-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

If they choose this option in wood, doesn't benefit at all.
But in fire, they don't have to worry about flames just the devil.
Choosing the flying boots in the Earth field doesn't offer any direct benefit,
as flying wouldn't help in navigating through the rocky terrain or facing the Earth Devil's attacks.
In Water, the flying boots allow the player to hover above the water's surface, avoiding underwater enemies and obstacles.

Opt 3: Shield of Reflection

-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

When wielded in the wood field scenario, the Shield of Reflection possesses a formidable chance of deflecting incoming attacks from enemies.
In the fire scenario it doesn't offer any special resistance to fire, its reflective properties still come into play when being attacked.
In the earth fields, it continues to prove its worth by offering a chance of deflecting attacks from enemies. As stones and debris bounce
against it towards the enemies.
In the water, it behaves similarly to its performance in the fire field. However, due to prolonged exposure to water,
 the shield gradually oxidizes after a certain number of uses.

Opt 4: ELixir of life 

-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

The Elixir of Life serves as a vital lifeline for the player, replenishing their health points when consumed.
This rejuvenating potion restores a portion of the player's HP, allowing them to recover from injuries sustained during battles 
or encounters with enemies. Additionally, after defeating three enemies in any of the four scenarios, the Elixir of Life magically refills, 
ready to be used again to aid the player in their quest through the field.




· 2nd decision: Weapon

*****************************  "Choose the arrow you are going to use agains the devil"  ************************************

4 options:


Opt 1: Fire arrow
Opt 2: Wood arrow
Opt 3: Water arrow
Opt 4: Stone arrow


-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

Wood:

If they choose fire, they'll burn the whole forest with themselves in. They loose all life points.
If they choose water, it won't affect much; they'll need to pass to second option: they get less life points as they give time 
to devil to attack.
If they choose a normal wood, it will simply break. Same as water, less life points.
If they choose the stone arrow, it will succesfully break the whole wood structure. Devil gets extremely hurted.

Fire:

If they choose fire, nothing happens to devil. Less life points.
If they choose water, it will start hurting the devil but doesn't do much.
If they choose wood, it will burn without effect as it is very heavy.
If they choose stone, it can go directly to the heart as it is thin.

Stone:

Water:
If they choose fire, it extinguishes upon contact with the water, making it a normal arrow. Therefore, unuseful against most enemies.
If they choose wood, it becomes waterlogged upon contact with the water, but instead of breaking, it absorbs the moisture and gains a 
unique property. When hitting an enemy, it drains a portion of the enemy's HP and transfers it to the user.
If they choose stone, it sinks into the water, making it difficult to retrieve and rendering it useless in combat.
If they choose water, it has no effect, as they essentially shoot water at water.
