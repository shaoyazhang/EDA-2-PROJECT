You are given 4 arrows of each element. You have an arrow that burst fire, another that bursts water,
a normal wood arrow (thiner than stone) and a stone arrow (which is stronger than wood).
Idea is they use them along other skills until they defeat the devil of each place without reaching 0 life points.
Of course in any given moment they can jump, and other things to avoid attacks.


· 1st decision: Protection.

******************************************** " Choose your protection wisely" ***************************************************
Here, they can choose between: 

Opt 1: Whole body armor 

-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

Choosen in wood, life points get reduced to significantly less when attacked.
In fire, theyreduce a little bit the attack but doesn't help with the flames in the floor. !Not good option for fire.
If chosen in the Earth field scenario, it provides high protection against stone attacks and reduces the damage taken. However, 
if the player triggers a rock trap in the hidden mines he will recieve +25% of damage.
In the Water field scenario, the whole body armor offers protection against some physical attacks from enemies encountered along the way.
However, it doesn't aid in swimming or traversing the river.

Opt 2: Flying boots

-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

If they choose this option in wood, doesn't benefit at all.
But in fire, they don't have to worry about flames just the devil.
Choosing the flying boots in the Earth field doesn't offer any direct benefit,
as flying wouldn't help in navigating through the rocky terrain or facing the Earth Devil's attacks.
In Water, the flying boots allow the player to hover above the water's surface, avoiding underwater enemies and obstacles.

Opt 3: 
-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

Opt 4:
-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 






· 2nd decision: Weapon

*****************************  "Choose the arrow you are going to use agains the devil"  ************************************

4 options:


Opt 1: Fire arrow
Opt 2: Wood arrow
Opt 3: Water arrow
Opt 4: Stone arrow


-------- How does it affect in each scenario? 

Wood:

If they choose fire, they'll burn the whole forest with themselves in. They loose all life points.
If they choose water, it won't affect much; they'll need to pass to second option: they get less life points as they give time 
to devil to attack.
If they choose a normal wood, it will simply break. Same as water, less life points.
If they choose the stone arrow, it will succesfully break the whole wood structure. Devil gets extremely hurted.

Fire:

If they choose fire, nothing happens to devil. Less life points.
If they choose water, it will start hurting the devil but doesn't do much.
If they choose wood, it will burn without effect as it is very heavy.
If they choose stone, it can go directly to the heart as it is thin.
