attacking from the shadows. Be careful exploring here, as both treasure and danger lurk within, 
where it's hard to tell what's real and what's just stories among the rustling leaves.

trees tiny creatures looking at you quietly.

a.1.1) Talk to creatures

You decide to talk to the creatures to see if they can help you get to the next element of Wuxing. These creatures stare at you without

and they try to attack you, you must defend yourself!

a.1.2) Ignore the creatures and go inside the cave
You find yourself alone in the cave. It's cold and smells like rotten wood. You can slightly see some sort of stairs that can 
help you climb the tree. You decide to do so. A the top of the tree there's a big throne and a tree-like big creature sitting in 
it. It looks asleep, but as you start walking away it wakes up. You got him angry and you have to defend yourself.

// Option 2 --> response
b) Take the road

You decide to take the road as it is more luminous. You don't see anything at first. It's very quite. Suddenly you see in the
distance the fire of the next element. You're almost there when all of a sudden you see a group of flying wood birds come your
way trying to attack you. 

b.1) You have to decide if you want to risk and run to the fire or hide inside a tree.

Through skillful negotiation, you manage to secure safe passage through the caverns without resorting to violence, preserving your
 life experience for future challenges.

Intrigued by the mysterious allure of the cave entrance, you cautiously step inside, seeking refuge from the blistering heat of the Fire
 Field. As you venture deeper into the cavern's shadowy depths, the air grows cooler, providing a brief respite from the oppressive heat outside.


a.2.1) Encounter a Fiery Guardian

As you progress further into the cave, you stumble upon a chamber guarded by a formidable fire elemental, its blazing eyes fixated on your every 
move. With danger lurking at every turn, you must decide whether to engage in battle with the fiery guardian or attempt to bypass it unnoticed.

 but at the cost of a portion of your life experience.

a.2.1.2) Bypass Unnoticed

Preferring to avoid unnecessary conflict, you carefully navigate around the fiery guardian, using stealth and cunning to evade its watchful gaze. 
He noticed you, and he won't let you pass unless you defeat him.

a.2.2) Discover a Hidden Passage

As you explore the cavern's winding tunnels, you stumble upon a hidden passage concealed behind a veil of shimmering flames. Intrigued by the promise 
of adventure that lies beyond, you muster your courage and venture forth into the unknown, eager to uncover the secrets hidden within the fiery depths 
of the cave.

Opting for a more direct route, you choose to cross the fiery bridge that spans the chasm of flames ahead. Each step brings you
 closer to the searing heat rising from below, testing your resolve with every fiery gust of wind.

Driven by a desire to reach the other side quickly, you break into a sprint, dodging flames that lick at your heels as you race
 across the bridge. With adrenaline coursing through your veins, you narrowly escape the fiery onslaught, but at a cost to your 
 life experience from the harrowing experience.

b.2) Take Shelter Beneath the Bridge risking being seen

Recognizing the danger posed by the fiery bridge, you seek shelter beneath its sturdy structure, waiting patiently for the flames
 to subside before continuing your journey. Though delayed, your cautious approach preserves your life experience, ensuring you're
  ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.
