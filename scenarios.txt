 

You're in the heart of a dark forest, it's the first element of Wuxing, wood. 
Watch out for the Wood Devil and other sneaky creatures armed with arrows made from the forest's own wood
attacking from the shadows. Be careful exploring here, as both treasure and danger lurk within, 
where it's hard to tell what's real and what's just stories among the rustling leaves.
Hint: Look after protecting yourself from the wood's devil as it is very strong.

// Decision question.
You see a dark river with a boat and on the left there is a luminous path, which path are you taking?

// Option 1 -->response
a) Take the boat

You decide to jump on the boat not knowing where the river takes. You start going through the river and you can see behind the 
trees tiny creatures looking at you quietly.

a.1)  You reach a point where the boat cannot continue sailing, you have to hop off. You're not sure if those creatures are kind,
should you go and talk to the creatures?. You also see a kind of dark cave inside a big tree. Do you want to go inside the cave? 

a.1.1) Talk to creatures

You decide to talk to the creatures to see if they can help you get to the next element of Wuxing. These creatures stare at you without
saying a word. Finally, you get tired of talking alone and you decide to walk away. In that moment, the creatures start screaming
and they try to attack you, you must defend yourself!

a.1.2) Ignore the creatures and go inside the cave
You find yourself alone in the cave. It's cold and smells like rotten wood. You can slightly see some sort of stairs that can 
help you climb the tree. You decide to do so. A the top of the tree there's a big throne and a tree-like big creature sitting in 
it. It looks asleep, but as you start walking away it wakes up. You got him angry and you have to defend yourself.

// Option 2 --> response
b) Take the road

You decide to take the road as it is more luminous. You don't see anything at first. It's very quite. Suddenly you see in the
distance the fire of the next element. You're almost there when all of a sudden you see a group of flying wood birds come your
way trying to attack you. 

b.1) You have to decide if you want to risk and run to the fire or hide inside a tree. 

b.1.1) Run!

You decide to run to escape but some birds reach you with the arrows (less life xp but they get to the final devil)

b.1.2) Hide!
You decide to hide until you don't hear them anymore. After a while you accomplish getting out. 


In all the cases, when the battle ends they encounter the wood devil and fight.

2nd scenario: Fire field

You find yourself in a place that looks and feels as if you're in hell. You made it to the second element of Wuxing, fire. 
You see the devil in flames. Pass its relentless fire attacks as you navigate through the flaming space in order to get out 
of this hot place whilst escaping the flames. Failure to withstand results in instant defeat, mission over.

At the crossroads of your journey, you confront two diverging paths; a volcano and a bridge. Where are you going?

a) Venture into the Volcano's Crater

Opting for the thrill of exploration, you decide to descend into the fiery depths of the volcano's crater. As you approach,
 waves of scorching heat wash over you, and the acrid smell of sulfur fills the air. Peering into the fiery abyss, you can make
  out the faint outline of a cave entrance beckoning you inside. You see Lava Caverns and a Cave. Choosee your path.

a.1) Explore the Lava Caverns

Intrigued by the promise of hidden treasures within the lava caverns, you venture deeper into the cavernous maze. Glowing veins
 of molten lava illuminate the rocky walls, casting an eerie light on your surroundings. Suddenly, you come face to face with a 
 fearsome fire elemental guarding a cache of ancient artifacts. Will you engage in battle for the chance to claim the treasure, 
 risking your life in the process?

a.1.1) Engage in Battle

With determination coursing through your veins, you ready your weapon and confront the fire elemental in a fierce battle. The 
clash of steel against flame echoes through the cavern as you fight for supremacy. Victory brings rewards beyond measure. 

a.1.2) Seek a Peaceful Resolution

Preferring diplomacy over conflict, you attempt to reason with the fire elemental, offering a peaceful solution to your encounter. 
Through skillful negotiation, you manage to secure safe passage through the caverns without resorting to violence, preserving your
 life experience for future challenges.


a.2) Explore the Cave Entrance

Intrigued by the mysterious allure of the cave entrance, you cautiously step inside, seeking refuge from the blistering heat of the Fire
 Field. As you venture deeper into the cavern's shadowy depths, the air grows cooler, providing a brief respite from the oppressive heat outside.


a.2.1) Encounter a Fiery Guardian

As you progress further into the cave, you stumble upon a chamber guarded by a formidable fire elemental, its blazing eyes fixated on your every 
move. With danger lurking at every turn, you must decide whether to engage in battle with the fiery guardian or attempt to bypass it unnoticed.

a.2.1.1) Engage in Battle

Drawing upon your strength and resolve, you prepare to confront the fiery guardian in a fierce battle for supremacy. With each strike, the clash 
of steel against flame reverberates through the cavern, testing your skills and determination to their limits. Victory brings rewards beyond measure,
 but at the cost of a portion of your life experience.

a.2.1.2) Bypass Unnoticed

Preferring to avoid unnecessary conflict, you carefully navigate around the fiery guardian, using stealth and cunning to evade its watchful gaze. 
He noticed you, and he won't let you pass unless you defeat him.

a.2.2) Discover a Hidden Passage

As you explore the cavern's winding tunnels, you stumble upon a hidden passage concealed behind a veil of shimmering flames. Intrigued by the promise 
of adventure that lies beyond, you muster your courage and venture forth into the unknown, eager to uncover the secrets hidden within the fiery depths 
of the cave.

b) Traverse the Fiery Bridge

Opting for a more direct route, you choose to cross the fiery bridge that spans the chasm of flames ahead. Each step brings you
 closer to the searing heat rising from below, testing your resolve with every fiery gust of wind.

b.1) Run Across the Bridge

Driven by a desire to reach the other side quickly, you break into a sprint, dodging flames that lick at your heels as you race
 across the bridge. With adrenaline coursing through your veins, you narrowly escape the fiery onslaught, but at a cost to your 
 life experience from the harrowing experience.

b.2) Take Shelter Beneath the Bridge risking being seen

Recognizing the danger posed by the fiery bridge, you seek shelter beneath its sturdy structure, waiting patiently for the flames
 to subside before continuing your journey. Though delayed, your cautious approach preserves your life experience, ensuring you're
  ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

3rd scenario: Earth field

As you journey on, you come across a rugged landscape, surrounded by towering cliffs and jagged rocks. 
Welcome to the third element of Wuxing, Earth. To your left is a dark, rocky path that climbs to the top of a giant mountain. 
And just on the opposite side, in the distance you can discern a town, an option that seems much quieter.

Which path do you want to take ?

a) Climb the mountain.   
    You decide to take the rocky path that climbs to the top of the giant mountain. As you ascend, the air grows colder and thinner,
    and the path becomes steeper and more treacherous. But your determination drives you forward, pushing you to conquer the formidable peak.

    After hours of arduous climbing, you finally reach a plateau halfway up the mountain. 
    Here, you encounter your first challenge: a group of mountain trolls guarding the path ahead. 
    They are large and fearsome, with rocky skin and clubs fashioned from ancient tree trunks.
    
    After overcoming the mountain trolls, you continue your ascent, determined to reach the summit.
    As you climb higher, the path grows narrower and more precarious, and the winds begin to howl ominously around you.

    What do you want to do ?

    a.1) Keep climbing the mountain.

    Finally, you reach the peak of the mountain, where a massive cavern looms before you. At the entrance a pair of stone guardians are waiting
    your arrival and confront you. (Battle begins)

    This is the lair of the Earth Devil, a fearsome rock golem that dwells deep within the mountain, your next adversary if you want to keep going.
    Its presence fills you with a sense of dread, but you know that confronting it is the only way to complete your quest.
    You can't see much because the obscurity of the golem's domain but you can feel all the cave shaking. 
    
        What are you going to do ?

        a.1.1) Run away from the cave and think of a new strategy.
                -While you are tourning around rock spikes come from the darkness and you get hit, the devil that was hidden beneath the rock
                floor starts to emerge. (You start the fight with 25% less HP)

        a.1.2) Get ready to fight!!!
                -Lots of rock spikes fly quickly towards you from the darkness, but you are able to dodge them. Beneath you the floor
                starts to breaking and the devil emerges in front of you. (The fight against the devil begins)

    a.2) Turn around.

    As soon as you tour around a giant boulder falls from the sky and you lose HP. (If you have the shield of reflection you are protected).
    The boulder destroys the path and you have no choice but keep going higher

b) Explore the town.
    You get to the town and it looks empty but you feel observed. It gets dark and you decide to sleep there but when you are about
    to close your eyes a rock troll (Hulking creatures with thick stone skin and massive clubs) attacks you:
    (The fight starts)

    After the town you follow your path and reach a fork, one path continues straight towards some desert lands,
    the other towards an old mine.

    What path are you choosing ?

        b.1) Explore the mine 
        You find danger signs that advert of traps and other dangers set by the miners to scare thiefs. You keep going and a pickaxe is thrown
        towards you from behind a column. Following it, a decaying corpse from a miner stands up and starts to run fiercley in you direction.
        (Battle begins).

        You keep walking and the path gets smaller every time until you get infront of a lever.
       
        What do you do ?
        
        you follow the path and after steping in a tile a boulder drops to your head (if you have the reflection 
        shield you are protected, and you have flying boots you are able to escape, if not you lose HP).

        Due to the being hit in the head you lose consciousness for a few seconds. Enough time to lose balance and fall into a hole filled 
        with darkness. 


        b.2) Follow the desrtic path.
        You find yourself in quicksand and in front a group of snakes,(Fight begins) you are able to defeat them but not to escape
        from the quicksand, you.

    (In both cases after this you fight the earth devil)


--------------------------------------

4th scenario: Water field

You finally arrive at your last destination, but what awaits you is even more breathtaking than you anticipated.
In front of you lies a vast expanse of water, the final element of Wuxing. Here, amidst the serene surface,
lurk hidden dangers and formidable enemies. Battle against fierce adversaries and overcome their aquatic assaults as you search
for the tool to unlock the power of swimming. Only then will you be able to traverse the raging river and emerge victorious.
But beware, defeat at the hands of your enemies will lead your journey to an abrupt end.

As you stand at the water's edge, you assess your options:

a) Dive into the water.
    With a determined resolve, you plunge into the cool depths of the water, ready to face whatever challenges lie beneath the surface.
    As you swim deeper, you encounter a school of razor-toothed piranhas, their sharp teeth glinting ominously in the dim light.
    They swarm around you, snapping their jaws hungrily, intent on making you their next meal. 
    (Battle begins, If you have the flying boots, you're able to fight them off with ease, your aerial advantage giving you the upper hand.
    But if not, you find your attacks slightly weakened by the resistance of the water.)
    a.1) After defeating the piranhas, you notice a floating wooden stem nearby, drifting lazily on the current. 
    Grasping it tightly, you find that it provides just enough buoyancy to keep you afloat in the water. 
    With your newfound makeshift floatation device,you continue your journey through the aquatic realm.

    But just as you begin to relax, a sudden surge of magic disrupts the water around you, and you find yourself
    face to face with a water wizard. This powerful sorcerer had been lurking beneath the surface,
    waiting for an unsuspecting victim to cross its path. (second fight)
    After a fierce battle, you emerge victorious,the wizard's magic fading into the depths. As you catch your breath,
    you feel a strange sensation wash over you. (You have absorved the wizard power and now you can swim freely)

    After swimming and escaping from other dangers, you find yourself standing before a dark cave,
    its yawning entrance beckoning you forward with a sense of foreboding.
    You can choose between tow options:

    a.1.1) Enter the cave
        Suddenly, as you step into the cave, you find yourself face to face with the water devil, 
        its menacing form looming ominously before you. In a desperate bid for survival, you must choose between two options,
        both of which involve destroying the cave entrance to prevent the water devil from pursuing you further. 
        Whether by collapsing the cave with brute force or using cunning tactics to outsmart your foe, the fate of your quest hangs in the balance.

    a.1.2) Continue exploring the deeps.
        As you continue swimming downstream, your journey is interrupted by a sudden attack from a group of magic sharks. With swift reflexes and unwavering determination,
        you fend off the vicious predators, their powerful jaws snapping hungrily at your heels. (Battle begins)

        Even that you defeates you enemies, you have not mastered the art of breathing under water yet. And in a few seconds after
        finishing the battle you find yourself succumbing to the darkness, your consciousness slips away as you lose consciousness.

        When you finally awaken, you find yourself inside the dark cave, face to face with the water devil itself.
        With the creature still sleeping soundly before you, you seize the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, hoping to catch it off guard and turn the tide of battle
        in your favor. (You attack first).


b) Search for a boat.
    Instead of diving headfirst into the water, you decide to search for a more cautious approach. Scanning the shoreline,
    you spot a weather-beaten rowboat half-buried in the sand, a relic of some forgotten voyage.
    You approach it cautiously, wary of any lurking dangers that may be hiding nearby.

    You sail but just as seconds past and a whirpool. You fight against a magician who trows powerful water spels

    After a fierce battle, you emerge victorious,the wizard's magic fading into the depths. As you catch your breath,
    you feel a strange sensation wash over you. (You have absorved the wizard power and now you can swim freely)

    b.1) After swimming and escaping from other dangers, you find yourself standing before a dark cave,
    its yawning entrance beckoning you forward with a sense of foreboding.
    You can choose between tow options:

    b.1.1) Enter the cave
        Suddenly, as you step into the cave, you find yourself face to face with the water devil, 
        its menacing form looming ominously before you. In a desperate bid for survival, you must choose between two options,
        both of which involve destroying the cave entrance to prevent the water devil from pursuing you further. 
        Whether by collapsing the cave with brute force or using cunning tactics to outsmart your foe, the fate of your quest hangs in the balance.

    b.1.2) Continue exploring the deeps.
        As you continue swimming downstream, your journey is interrupted by a sudden attack from a group of magic sharks. With swift reflexes and unwavering determination,
        you fend off the vicious predators, their powerful jaws snapping hungrily at your heels. (Battle begins)

        Even that you defeates you enemies, you have not mastered the art of breathing under water yet. And in a few seconds after
        finishing the battle you find yourself succumbing to the darkness, your consciousness slips away as you lose consciousness.
