1st scenario that they find: Wood field
 

You're in the heart of a dark forest, it's the first element of Wuxing, wood. 
Watch out for the Wood Devil and other sneaky creatures armed with arrows made from the forest's own wood
attacking from the shadows. Be careful exploring here, as both treasure and danger lurk within, 
where it's hard to tell what's real and what's just stories among the rustling leaves.
Protect yourself from the wood's devil as it is very strong.


2nd scenario: Fire.

You find yourself in a place that looks and feels as if you're in hell. You made it to the second element of Wuxing, fire. 
You see the devil in flames. Pass its relentless fire attacks as you navigate through the flaming space in order to get out 
of this hot place whilst escaping the flames. Be careful, the whole floor is full of flames.
Failure to withstand results in instant defeat, mission over.
Hint: The best way to defeat this devil is to attack his heart, as this is the weakest point.
