b) Kind of game we intend to build:

The game is a text-based, role-playing adventure where players navigate through a series of scenarios by making decisions that influence the narrative and outcomes. Players assume the roles of characters with various attributes and skills, encountering different enemies and challenges. The game's mechanics focus on decision-making, strategic combat, and storytelling, creating an immersive experience driven by player choices. It blends elements of interactive fiction and role-playing games, providing a rich, narrative-driven gameplay experience.

In our game, the protagonist embarks on an exhilarating adventure in pursuit of the four elements of Wuxing. To secure this legendary tome, they must navigate through four distinct landscapes: the lush Wood, the blazing Fire, the rugged Earth, and the turbulent Water.

Each realm presents its own set of challenges and adversaries, putting the hero's skills to the test. With unique tasks and missions in every domain, from cunning puzzles to daring escapades, success hinges on conquering all four trials. Only then can the intrepid explorer claim the coveted book and emerge as the ultimate victor of the game.


c) Functionalities we wish to add to our game:

The game features a text-based adventure where players navigate through various scenarios by making decisions that affect the game's outcome. It includes functionalities for initializing the game environment from JSON files, managing character attributes and skills, handling enemy encounters, and executing game logic within a structured game loop. 

Players interact with the game world through a series of decisions, each presenting different narrative paths and challenges. The system tracks character stats such as health, attack, and defense, and supports dynamic combat mechanics against enemies, integrating skill-based actions and strategy. The game ensures an engaging experience by offering diverse scenarios and outcomes based on player choices.
