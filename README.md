b) What kind of game you intend to build
In our game the protagonist on an exhilarating adventure in pursuit of the four elements of Wuxing. But here's the twist – to secure this legendary tome, they must navigate through four distinct landscapes: the lush Wood, the blazing Fire, the rugged Earth, and the turbulent Water.

Each realm presents its own set of challenges and adversaries, putting our hero's skills to the test. With unique tasks and missions in every domain, from cunning puzzles to daring escapades, success hinges on conquering all four trials. Only then can our intrepid explorer claim the coveted book and emerge as the ultimate victor of the game.


c) What type of functionalities do you wish to add to your game

We plan to add four different scenarios to play in, the option to choose from four different characters, and objects with unique abilities and stats. Additionally, there will be new decisions for each of the four scenarios.
